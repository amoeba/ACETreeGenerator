# ACETreeGenerator

Generate a synthetic allegiance tree for testing [ACEmulator](https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE).

## Running

When I run this, I:

0. Ensure my MySQL database is running
1. Shut down my ACE Server
2. `dotnet run`

## FYI

- This creates characters but not complete ones. PRs would be welcome to add more information and if you know a better way to create characters for testing purposes please let me know.
